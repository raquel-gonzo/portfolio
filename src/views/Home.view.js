          <p>
            I am a Software Developer knowledgable in Full-Stack development. I like working on projects related to responsive front-end development and using modern Javascript frameworks. I love learning new things and applying them in my personal and professional work. 
            I live in Chicago, IL and I'm currently looking for a new role in the Software Development field. I'm a proud member of #LatinasInTech and #Techqueria <span role="img" aria-label="Mexican flag emoji">ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½</span> 
          </p>

          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can usually find me playing violin or cooking a new vegetarian recipe.
